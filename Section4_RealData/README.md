The RealData_DiffWaveAnalysis.R script was used to analyze the real preschooler ERP data presented in Section 4 of Heise et al. (2025). We compared eight approaches for analyzing ERP difference waves:

* Six trial-level LME approaches: Interaction, Exact Match, three types of Nearest Neighbor, and Random Permutation
* Two conventional regression approaches using common trial thresholds for mean-averaged data: 10 trials per condition and 15 trials per condition

Prior to analysis, trial-level ERPs were processed using the pipeline described in Heise, Mon, and Bowman (2022).
