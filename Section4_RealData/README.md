The RealData_LMEAnalysis.R script was used to analyze the real preschooler ERP data presented in Section 4 of Heise et al. (submitted). We compared approaches for analyzing ERP difference waves:

* Trial-level LME approaches: Interaction, Exact Match, three types of Nearest Neighbor, and Random Permutation
* Conventional condition-level ANOVA/regression approach using two common trial thresholds: 10 trials per condition and 15 trials per condition

Prior to analysis, trial-level ERPs were processed using the pipeline described in Heise, Mon, and Bowman (2022).
