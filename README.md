# LME_MixedEffectsERPDifferenceWave

This GitHub page contains linear mixed effects model (LME) scripts for analyzing ERP difference wave mean amplitude from Heise, Mon, and Bowman (2025).

* **Section3_SimulatedData**: Scripts used to simulate and analyze realistic developmental ERP data reported in Section 3 of manuscript. 

* **Section4_RealData**: Script used to analyze real preschooler ERP data reported in Section 4 of manuscript. 
  
For additional introductory resources and scripts for analyzing mean amplitude data, see the lab's related repository: [https://github.com/basclab/LME_MixedEffectsERPTutorial](https://github.com/basclab/LME_MixedEffectsERPTutorial)
