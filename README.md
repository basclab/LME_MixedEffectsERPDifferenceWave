# LME_MixedEffectsERPDifferenceWave

This GitHub page contains linear mixed effects model (LME) scripts for analyzing ERP difference wave mean amplitude from Heise, Mon, and Bowman (submitted):

* **Scripts**: Pipeline for simulating realistic developmental ERP data for difference wave analysis. Scripts correspond to Section 3 of Heise et al (submitted).  

* **ExampleOutputFiles**: Example simulated data files created using the pipeline from the Scripts folder. 
  
For additional introductory resources and scripts for analyzing mean amplitude data, see the lab's related repository: [https://github.com/basclab/LME_MixedEffectsERPTutorial](https://github.com/basclab/LME_MixedEffectsERPTutorial)
