Example mean amplitude .txt files created by the DiffWaveSim_02_SimulateERPData.m script for the 'different decay rate' condition.

Each file contains the following columns:
* value: The mean amplitude for this simulated subjectâ€™s specified bin and electrode. This value is extracted from C4 (corresponding to E104 of the EGI HydroCel GSN 128-electrode montage) over a 300-500 ms time window.
* chindex: The electrode number (e.g., electrode #1 corresponds to E104 in this simulation).
* chlabel: The label for this electrode (e.g., E104).
* bini: A number generated by ERPLAB when concatenating ERP data files across each sample's subjects. NOTE: This number is NOT used for subsequent processing.
* binlabel: A label composed of [SUBJECTID]_:_[trial-specific bin label]. The trial-specific bin label corresponds to the labels from the bin descriptor file (created in DiffWaveSim_01_CreateBinDescriptorFile.m). The binlabel column is used to identify subject ID and stimuli-related  information in DiffWaveSim_03_OrganizeDataFiles.R.
* ERPset: This column is intentionally empty because it is NOT needed for identifying subject ID (see binlabel column above).
