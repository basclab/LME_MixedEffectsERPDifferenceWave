Example mean amplitude .csv files formatted for statistical analysis by the DiffWaveSim_03_OrganizeDataFiles.R script for the 'different decay rate' condition.

Each file contains the following columns:
* SUBJECTID: Simulated subject ID (e.g., 01, 02, ...)
* mSens: Simulated maternal sensitivity group (i.e., lowMSens, higMSens)
* age: Simulated age group (i.e., youngerAgeGroup, olderAgeGroup)
* emotion: Simulated emotion condition (i.e., A, B)
* ACTOR: Simulated stimulus actor ID (i.e., 01, 02, 03, 04, 05)
* presentNumber: Trial presentation number of specific stimulus (emotion condition/actor) ranging from 1 to 10
* meanAmpNC: Simulated mean amplitude value (in units of microvolts)
